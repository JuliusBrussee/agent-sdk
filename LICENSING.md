# Licensing

The entire repository is Apache-2.0. Root `LICENSE` governs every path, and
every shipped npm package carries its own copy of the license text.
`npm run license:check` enforces this map and rejects proprietary package
classifications.

## Per-Directory License

| Path | License | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/pebble-protocol/` | Apache-2.0 | Open protocol: events, ACP wire, and session schema. |
| `packages/adapter-kit/` | Apache-2.0 | Contract only — public interfaces/types for framework adapters. |
| `packages/adapter-conformance/` | Apache-2.0 | Deterministic adapter conformance runner and report contract. |
| `packages/agent/` | Apache-2.0 | Agent runtime, compiler, and compatibility exports. |
| `packages/coding-agent/` | Apache-2.0 | Coding-agent API and CLI. |
| `packages/create-caveman-agent/` | Apache-2.0 | Project initializer. |

Unlisted paths inherit the root Apache-2.0 license. Third-party dependencies
remain under their own terms. Proprietary Pebble product implementation lives
only in private sibling repository `caveman-coding-agent` under commercial
terms and must not be copied here.
