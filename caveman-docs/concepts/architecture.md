# Architecture

## What this SDK owns that a tool-loop SDK does not

Most agent SDKs stop at model calls and a tool loop. Caveman also owns the
context lifecycle and the runtime evidence around it:

- **Context lifecycle** — what enters the provider-visible prefix, what stays
  live, when it is compacted, and whether the original bytes can be recovered
  exactly.
- **Runtime evidence** — a receipt per run listing every model and tool call,
  its usage basis, its price basis, and how the run stopped.
- **Fail-closed accounting** — a budget that reserves before it spends, and
  refuses to book an imaginary `$0` against a model the catalog cannot price.
- **Eval-gated builds** — a lock artifact that only exists when declared
  quality gates passed.

Everything else — the tool loop itself, steering queues, lifecycle hooks, the
event stream — comes from exact-pinned Pi. The repo rule is explicit: consuming
a Pi hook to enforce an invariant Pi lacks is the product; re-exposing a Pi
surface under a Caveman name is refused duplication.

Directories under `packages/` that are not in the root `workspaces` array
(`pebble`, `pebble-sessions`, `pebble-tui`, `libpebble`, `shared`) are
supporting or internal material.

## Ownership boundaries

| Package | Owns | Explicitly does not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent` | Framework-neutral execution, tools, budgets, breakers, receipts, durability, Context IR, profile/eval/compiler, fail-closed accounting, the optional Connect protocol client | OAuth, credential storage, provider transport for Connect (that is external `cave-connectd`) |
| `adapter-kit` | Manifest schema, capability vocabulary and states, registry, lifecycle validation, conformance metadata | Any framework import, any Caveman runtime import |
| `adapters/*` | One upstream pin each, one binding entrypoint, one capability manifest | A second host implementation of anything core already does |
| `adapter-conformance` | Deterministic candidate evidence: test vector, clocks, thresholds, digests | Turning a report into a `certified` manifest state |
| `coding-agent` | Coding UX, CLI, tools, session presentation, coding benchmarks | Runtime invariants — it consumes them |
| `create-caveman-agent` | Project generation | Anything at runtime |
| `evals` | Grader names, option types, validation, verdict semantics | A second evaluator inside `agent` |
| `pebble-protocol` | Frozen public wire, event, and session contracts | The Pebble runtime, sessions, policy, and TUI, which live in a private sibling repository |

## Dependency direction

```text
adapter-kit  <──  adapter-*  ──peer──>  agent
coding-agent ──peer─────────────────>  agent
create-agent ──generated project────>  agent
```

Core never imports an adapter package. Installing `@caveman-ai/agent` must not
pull in Vercel, Mastra, or Eve. The shared registry stays framework-neutral so
the graph has no cycle.

## The two outward seams

Caveman attaches to a foreign framework in exactly two places.

| Seam | Module | Scales by | Carries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The wire (`fetch`) | `@caveman-ai/agent/wire` | Provider | Request ceiling, exact usage accounting, provider-native cache hints |
| The model boundary | `packages/adapters/*` | Framework | Compaction, model routing — anything that must stay in sync with framework-owned state |

The split is load-bearing, not stylistic. Compaction at the wire would leave the
framework's own message history describing a transcript the model never saw; the
framework would then rebuild the next request from stale state and silently undo
the compaction. `src/compaction.ts` is documented as the only place in the
package that rewrites model-visible context. Full rationale:
[`docs/PORTABILITY.md`](../../docs/PORTABILITY.md).

## Execution paths inside `agent`

```text
run() / stream()          ordinary run, no lock
runLocked()               validated Cave Build execution, refuses drift before provider traffic
createAgentServer()       one definition behind HTTP, every run journaled
compileProfiledNativePi() compiler-owned runner; only native tool-free Pi can lower a plan
compileProfiled()         generic caller-owned runner; baseline-equivalent v3 only
```

`run()` cannot inject a plan or a build identity. `npm run dev`, `build`, and
`check` own validated Cave Build execution.

## Where the source lives

| Context rewriting (the only place) | `packages/agent/src/compaction.ts` |

| Provider `fetch` transport | `packages/agent/src/wire.ts` |
| Model boundary contract | `packages/agent/src/model-boundary.ts` |
| Sandbox execution and probes | `packages/agent/src/runtime.ts`, `tool-worker.ts`, `sandbox-*.ts` |
| Memory engine and adapters | `packages/agent/src/memory*.ts` |
