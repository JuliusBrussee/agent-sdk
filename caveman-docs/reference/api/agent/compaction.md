## Interfaces

### `CompactionOptions`

Budget-triggered compaction: while four full cold next-call ceilings remain,
compress instead of waiting for exhaustion to make the rewrite unaffordable.

This file is the only place in

```ts
export interface CompactionOptions {
    /**
     * How many times one run may compact. Defaults to 1: repeated-compaction
     * degradation is real and unmeasured, a budget-bound run is short by
     * construction, and one compaction is the case the affordability model can
     * actually predict.
     */
    readonly maxCompactions?: number;
    /** Token budget for the verbatim recent tail. Defaults to 8,000. */
    readonly keepRecentTokens?: number;
    /**
     * Hard cap on the summary's own output. Output length is the dominant cost
     * term of a compaction event. Defaults to 2,048.
     */
    readonly summaryMaxTokens?: number;
    /**
     * Minimum context reduction that makes a compaction worth its call. A rewrite
     * that frees a few thousand tokens has paid a summarizer call and a full
     * cache rewrite for nothing. Defaults to 20,000.
     */
    readonly minYieldTokens?: number;
    /**
     * Working calls the post-compaction budget must still cover. Break-even is
     * several calls, so a compaction that buys exactly one is guaranteed to lose.
     * Defaults to 3.
     */
    readonly headroomCalls?: number;
    /**
     * Cap on pinned user-intent text carried verbatim through a compaction,
     * newest-first. Defaults to 20,000.
     */
    readonly pinnedUserTokens?: number;
    /**
     * Preserve the first real user message verbatim even when it exceeds the
     * normal pin budget. Defaults to true. A compaction may decline for poor
     * yield, but it may not silently replace the task that created the run.
     */
    readonly preserveFirstUserMessage?: boolean;
    /**
     * Opt in to a different, usually cheaper summarizer.
     *
     * The default is deliberately the run's **own working model**, with the
     * compaction request built by the same request builder as a working call —
     * same system prompt, same tool definitions, same history, the compaction
     * instruction appended as the final user message. A summarizer with its own
     * prompt shape diverges at the first token and forfeits the entire cached
     * prefix, which costs more than the cheaper rate saves on every mid-tier
     * model. Opting in is gated on the summarizer's context window covering the
     * history it has to read; below that it fails closed to the working model.
     */
    readonly summarizerModel?: Model<Api>;

    readonly recent: readonly number[];
    /**
     * Stale tool output that can be elided to a citation for free. Selected by

}
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction.d.ts`.

## Type aliases

### `ContextAnchorKind`

The sectioned summary the summarizer must produce.

Structure rather than prose keeps required fields explicit. `constraintsRestated`
is a restatement only — the pinned buffer is the carrier, and a summary that
becomes the only carrier reproduces the failure this design exists to avoid.

```ts
export type ContextAnchorKind = "objective" | "constraint" | "decision" | "artifact" | "fact" | "blocker" | "next";
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction.d.ts`.

### `ContextCompactionSummarizer`

Adapter seam for provider, local model, replay, or deterministic oracle.

```ts
export type ContextCompactionSummarizer = (request: ContextCompactionSummarizerRequest) => Promise<string> | string;
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction-harness.d.ts`.

### `ContextSummarySourceRole`

```ts
export type ContextSummarySourceRole = "user" | "assistant" | "tool" | "capsule";
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction.d.ts`.

## Functions

### `contextSummarySources`

Build the digest-addressed manifest for messages a rewrite may remove.

```ts
export declare function contextSummarySources(messages: readonly AgentMessage[], indexes: readonly number[]): readonly ContextSummarySource[];
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction.d.ts`.

### `elidedDigest`

```ts
export declare function elidedDigest(message: AgentMessage): string;
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction.d.ts`.

### `evaluateContextSummary`

Exact-match evaluator. Paraphrase is drift for paths, commands, and contracts.

```ts
export declare function evaluateContextSummary(summary: ContextSummary, input: ContextSummaryEvaluationInput): ContextSummaryEvaluation;
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction-eval.d.ts`.

### `evaluateContextSummaryStability`

Validate a repeated-compaction series, including generation and anchor drift.

```ts
export declare function evaluateContextSummaryStability(rounds: readonly ContextSummaryRound[]): ContextSummaryStability;
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction-eval.d.ts`.

### `evictionCitation`

The citation a free eviction leaves behind, carrying enough to identify what left.

```ts
export declare function evictionCitation(message: AgentMessage, index: number): string;
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction.d.ts`.

### `evictMessage`

Replace a tool result's text content with its citation, leaving the pair intact.

```ts
export declare function evictMessage(message: AgentMessage, index: number): AgentMessage;
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction.d.ts`.

### `latestContextSummary`

Recover the newest trusted capsule from model-visible conversation history.

```ts
export declare function latestContextSummary(messages: readonly AgentMessage[]): ContextSummary | undefined;
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction.d.ts`.

### `messagesTokens`

```ts
export declare function messagesTokens(messages: readonly AgentMessage[]): number;
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction.d.ts`.

### `messageText`

```ts
export declare function messageText(message: AgentMessage): string;
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction.d.ts`.

### `messageTokens`

Rough token size of one message: UTF-16 code units divided by four.

NOTE: this is NOT the basis the budget meter reserves in. The
meter's `inputTokenCeiling` bounds a call by its UTF-8 BYTE count (a loose
~4x-of-tokens ceiling that never under-reserves), while this is a ~1x token
ESTIMATE from character count. The two are not commensurable, so a compaction
yield gate expressed in these tokens does not translate one-to-one to the
bytes the reserve counts. The two remain separate provider-counting bases.

```ts
export declare function messageTokens(message: AgentMessage): number;
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction.d.ts`.

### `normalizeCompaction`

```ts
export declare function normalizeCompaction(options?: CompactionOptions): NormalizedCompaction;
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction.d.ts`.

### `parseContextSummary`

Parse and validate a summarizer response. Fails closed: an unparseable or
structurally wrong summary is discarded and the caller falls through to the
clamp rung. A malformed summary is never accepted.

```ts
export declare function parseContextSummary(text: string): ContextSummary | undefined;
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction.d.ts`.

### `pinnedContentSurvives`

Whether every pinned message's content survives verbatim in a rewrite.

Compares TEXT, not object identity. An identity check against the very
objects a compaction just placed into its output can only succeed, which is
no assertion at all — this is the check that can actually fail, and failing
it sends the run to the clamp rung with the original context intact.

```ts
export declare function pinnedContentSurvives(original: readonly AgentMessage[], pinned: readonly number[], rewritten: readonly AgentMessage[]): boolean;
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction.d.ts`.

### `planCompaction`

Decide what survives a compaction, in IR terms rather than message positions.

- `user` messages are user intent: pinned, newest-first, under a token cap.
- The recent tail is a token budget, not a turn count, extended until the
  retained window is self-contained — no surviving tool result may reference
  a dropped tool call.
- A stale tool result becomes a citation instead of prose, and the most
  recent result per tool name is never stale.

On that last rule, precisely: the selection is by message role and freshness,
not by reading a `recovery` field. It relies on the fact that every runtime
tool result the IR lowers carries `recovery: "exact_ccr"` — see
`appendRuntimeContextSegment` in context-ir.ts — so the whole class is
reversible and eliding one to a citation loses nothing that cannot be
recomputed. Driving the choice from each segment's own `recovery` would be
strictly better, because it would extend to declared contexts whose recovery
varies; it is not what this code does today.

```ts
export declare function planCompaction(messages: readonly AgentMessage[], config: NormalizedCompaction): MessagePlan;
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction.d.ts`.

### `renderSummary`

Render a validated summary back to the wire shape used in a follow-up request.

```ts
export declare function renderSummary(summary: ContextSummary): Record<string, unknown>;
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction.d.ts`.

### `runContextCompactionHarness`

Run repeated, generational compaction against any injected summarizer.
Provider credentials and transport remain adapter-owned and explicit.

```ts
export declare function runContextCompactionHarness(fixture: ContextCompactionFixture, summarize: ContextCompactionSummarizer, options?: ContextCompactionHarnessOptions): Promise<ContextCompactionHarnessResult>;
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction-harness.d.ts`.

### `summarizationInstruction`

The instruction appended as the final user message of the summarization request.

```ts
export declare function summarizationInstruction(previous: ContextSummary | undefined, sources?: readonly ContextSummarySource[]): string;
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction.d.ts`.

### `validateContextSummaryTransition`

Validate one capsule transition against its source manifest. This check is
deterministic and model-independent. A caller commits only when `ok`.

```ts
export declare function validateContextSummaryTransition(summary: ContextSummary, previous: ContextSummary | undefined, sources: readonly ContextSummarySource[]): ContextSummaryValidation;
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction.d.ts`.

## Variables & constants

### `SUMMARY_SCHEMA_VERSION`

Version of the summary contract the summarizer is asked to emit.

```ts
export declare const SUMMARY_SCHEMA_VERSION = 2;
```

Declared in `packages/agent/dist/compaction.d.ts`.
