# Caveman Agent SDK documentation

Complete documentation for the Caveman Agent SDK monorepo: the runtime, the
profile-guided compiler, the adapters, the coding agent, the initializer, and
the frozen Pebble protocol.

Everything here describes the code in this checkout. Where a behavior is gated,
unproven, or deliberately incomplete, the page says so instead of rounding up.

## Start here

| If you want to… | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Get an agent running in five minutes | [Getting started](guides/01-getting-started.md) |
| Understand what the SDK actually owns | [Architecture](concepts/architecture.md) |
| Know what "inferred", "measured", and "verified" mean | [The honesty model](concepts/honesty-model.md) |
| Understand `optimized` vs `observe-only` | [Execution modes](concepts/execution-modes.md) |
| Attach Caveman to an existing framework | [Migrating](guides/17-migrating.md) |
| Look up a type, function, or option | [API reference](reference/api/README.md) |
| Look up a failure code | [Reserved `cave_` identifiers](reference/identifiers.md) |

## Guides

Task-shaped, in roughly the order you meet them.

| 15 | [Plugins and skills](guides/15-plugins-and-skills.md) | Agent Skills, Agent Plugins v1, OpenPlugin, slash commands |
| 16 | [Adapters and the wire transport](guides/16-adapters-and-wire.md) | Nine lanes, the model boundary, `createCavemanTransport` |
| 17 | [Migrating to Caveman](guides/17-migrating.md) | The three depths, per-framework mapping, rollback |
| 18 | [The coding agent](guides/18-coding-agent.md) | `@caveman-ai/coding-agent`, `caveman-code`, the token bill |
| 19 | [The Pebble protocol](guides/19-pebble-protocol.md) | 19 turn events, JSONL framing, ACP mapping, session entries |

## Concepts

| Page | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| [Architecture](concepts/architecture.md) | What each package owns and why the boundaries are where they are |
| [The honesty model](concepts/honesty-model.md) | Claim bases, fail-closed rules, what the SDK refuses to assert |
| [Execution modes](concepts/execution-modes.md) | `optimized`, `observe-only`, locked runs, gateway degradation |

## Reference

| Page | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| [API reference](reference/api/README.md) | Every exported symbol of every published entrypoint, generated from the built type declarations |
| [CLI](reference/cli.md) | `caveman-agent` and `caveman-code`, every command and flag |
| [Environment variables](reference/environment.md) | Every variable the runtime, CLI, and sandbox read |
| [Artifacts and files](reference/artifacts.md) | `.caveman/*`, lock envelopes, profiles, build reports, journals |
| [Reserved `cave_` identifiers](reference/identifiers.md) | All 726 failure codes, tool names, and refusal reasons |
| [Packages](reference/packages.md) | Every workspace package, its purpose, exports, and install line |
| [Glossary](reference/glossary.md) | Twenty-five terms — direct, session, durable store, execution backend, basis, Cave Build — each naming the file that owns it |

## Regenerating the generated pages

```bash
npm run build                      # refresh the .d.ts surface first
node scripts/generate-docs-api.mjs # rewrites reference/api/** and reference/identifiers.md
```

Generated pages carry a banner and must not be hand-edited: the next run
overwrites them. Guides, concepts, and the non-generated reference pages are
hand-maintained.

## Requirements

- Node.js `>=22.19.0` for every package except the Eve adapter, which needs `>=24`.
- One provider credential (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or
  `GEMINI_API_KEY`/`GOOGLE_API_KEY`).
- No Caveman account. Nothing here requires a hosted service; without the local
  Caveman Engine a run is `observe-only` and says so.

## License

Apache-2.0. The Claude Agent SDK lane depends on software governed by Anthropic
terms; see [`LICENSING.md`](../LICENSING.md) and that adapter's README.
