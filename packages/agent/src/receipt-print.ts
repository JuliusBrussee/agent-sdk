/**
 * The end-of-run receipt print (golden artifact F1).
 *
 * `renderReceipt` is a pure function — receipt-shaped JSON in, text out — and
 * its output is snapshot-tested byte-for-byte against `goldens/receipt-*.txt`.
 * Editing a golden is a product decision, not a test fix; if this renderer
 * disagrees with a golden, this renderer is wrong.
 *
 * Honesty rules the goldens encode, restated where the code enforces them:
 * - every cost is a public-catalog list-price subtotal, never an invoice,
 *   and the line says so;
 * - the cold estimate is a counterfactual labelled `inferred`, never
 *   subtracted into any other figure, and computed over the SAME scope as
 *   the cost line (root and subagent calls together) so a subagent's spend
 *   can never masquerade as a cache-write premium — on a RESUMED run the
 *   cost line also covers prior attempts this attempt's calls cannot
 *   reprice, so the cold-estimate line is dropped rather than compared
 *   across scopes;
 * - an unpriced model prints its honest flag instead of $0;
 * - a run with no model calls anywhere prints an honest absence;
 * - a stopped run says it stopped, and a breached cap prints the overage
 *   explicitly — never a negative percent;
 * - every mode is named, and observe-only names its upgrade (F8).
