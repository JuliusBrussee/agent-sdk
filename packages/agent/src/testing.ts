/**
 * The two-piece test kit every test in this repo was hand-rolling: a model
 * that costs nothing to call, and a stream that answers from a script.
 *
 * Neither talks to a provider, and neither is wired into the runtime — they
 * are values you pass to `run()`/`stream()` as `model` and `streamFn`:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { fauxModel, scriptedStream } from "@caveman-ai/agent/testing";
 *
 * const result = await run(myAgent, "go", {
 *   model: fauxModel(),
 *   streamFn: scriptedStream([
 *     { toolCalls: [{ name: "poll", args: {} }] },
 *     { text: "done", usage: { input: 120, output: 8 } },
 *   ]),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * A run driven by a `streamFn` is always billed `observe-only`: this process
 * produced the turn, so nothing about it can be claimed as optimized.
